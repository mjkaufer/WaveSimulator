# WaveSimulator
:ocean: customizable 3D simulation of constructive/destructive interference

The simulator is live [here](http://www.kaufer.org/WaveSimulator/).

There are four wave generators you can enable/disable, from the dropdown on the right. You can enable/disable each generator, and set position, frequency, and magnitude.

You can drag with your mouse to change your viewpoint, and zoom in/out with your mouse wheel.
